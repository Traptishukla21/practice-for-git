purpose for learning git
git is developed by linus torvalds
git is a free open source, distributed version control system.
it's a software tool that track changes in files and folders , allowing developers to collaborate on projects and manage different versions of their code effectively.
it's help in tracking the history of modifications, and revert to previous versions if needed.
git branching strategy :- git allows developers to create branches (separate copies of the codebase) for new features or bug fixes, work on them independently, and then merge them back into the main branch when ready. this makes it easier to manage different versions and avoid conflicts.
git workflow :- working area(vi file1) - stagging area(git add) - local repo(git commit) - remote repo(git push).
